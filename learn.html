                        Hearts is a trick-taking card game where each player competes individually.

                        <br>
                        Typically recommended for ages 13 and up. It’s most often played with four players, though variations accommodate three or five.

                        Your goal is to finish with the lowest total score. The game ends once a player reaches or exceeds a pre-agreed point threshold (commonly 100).

                        <br>
                        At the end of each round, you tally one point for each heart you’ve taken and 13 points for the queen of spades. If a player captures all 13 hearts and the queen of spades in one hand, they score zero while each opponent adds 26 points.

                        <br>
                        Cards are dealt face-down, one at a time, clockwise. In a four-player game, each gets 13 cards. For three players, remove the 2 of diamonds and deal 17 cards each. In five-player play, remove the 2 of clubs so each player can get 10 cards.

                        <strong> The Play </strong>
                        <br>
                        The player holding the 2 of clubs starts. (If that card was removed, then the 3 of clubs leads.) Players must follow the suit led if able; if not, they may play any other card—but they may not discard a heart or the queen of spades in the first trick unless they have no clubs. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner leads the next. Hearts cannot be led until a heart or the queen of spades has been played (“broken”). There is no trump suit.

                        The aim is to be the first player to reach 500 net points by forming melds (sets of 3 or 4 of a kind) and/or sequences (runs of 3 or more cards in the same suit), and by being the first to empty your hand.

                        <br>
                        Points are scored by laying down sets or runs, and by adding cards to existing melds. Cards between 2-9 are worth 5 points. Cards between 10, J, Q, and K are worth 10 points. If Aces are played as 1 (ex: A, 2, 3), then it is worth 5 points. If Aces are played as 13 or a set, then it is worth 15 points. When a player empties their hand, the round ends. Each player’s score is calculated as:
                        <ul>
                            <li class="bullet"> Points for all cards they have laid on the table. </li>

                        <strong> Card Values / Scoring </strong>
                        <br>
                        Cards are played by rank in a set sequence: Ace, 2, 3, 4, … up to King, then back to Ace. There is no numeric “scoring” system in the usual sense (points); success is simply dropping all your cards first. The risk: if you are challenged and caught bluffing, you must pick up the entire discard pile. If you are challenged and found to be honest, the challenger picks up the pile.

                        A social shedding‑type card game where players aim to be the first to get rid of all their cards, jockeying for the best role (President) and avoiding the worst (Scum). You choose to have a Vice-President and Vice-Scum if there are more than 4 people.

                        The goal is to be the first player to discard all your cards in a round. The first to do so becomes the “President,” the second becomes “Vice President,” and the last with cards becomes the “Scum," the second becomes Vice Scum." Future rounds carry role/status consequences.

                        Cards are dealt face-down, one at a time, clockwise. After the first game, cards are to be dealt into piles, and then the top cards are flipped face-up. If there are duplicate cards, then flip the 2nd card, below the duplicates, face up. President then gets to choose which pile they desire, then the Vice-President, and so forth, based on the order of which players threw all of their cards from the previous game. Scum will of course pick last.
